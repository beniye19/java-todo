I# Java-Week3-ToDo-List

Author: Benson Mwangi Mwangi


Welcome to the official repository for the "To Do List" project implemented in Java, utilizing the Spark web framework, Handlebars templating engine, and more. Each branch in this repository represents a new development step in the project's evolution. To get started, fork this repository and then clone it to your local environment.

This project follows a structured approach, with each branch introducing new features or improvements. By navigating through the branches, you can observe the incremental development process and learn how to build a robust To-Do List application using Java and associated technologies.

To begin, ensure you have the necessary development tools set up on your machine. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and choose a build automation tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies effectively.

Spark serves as the foundational web framework for handling HTTP requests and responses, while Handlebars provides an intuitive templating solution for generating dynamic HTML content.

As you explore each branch, pay attention to the project's structure and organization. Typically, a Java web application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with distinct components for models (data representation), controllers (business logic), and views (user interface).

You'll find implementation examples for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which are essential for managing To-Do items effectively. Additionally, consider integrating a database system to persist To-Do items across sessions. Options range from lightweight embedded databases like H2 to robust solutions like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on testing. Unit tests validate individual components' functionality, while integration tests ensure seamless interaction between various parts of the application.
